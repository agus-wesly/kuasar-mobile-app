              and correct any personal data that we hold about you, subject to
              the requirements of the PDPA, as well as to request a copy of your
              information, which you have previously provided to us. If you want
              to exercise any of these rights, please contact Our Data

              nature and the background of your request

              4. Note that the PDPA exempts certain types of personal data from
              being subject to your correction request. It also provides a
              regulatory framework when correction need not be made by us
              despite your request. We will send the corrected personal data to
              every other organisation to which the personal data was disclosed
              by us within a year before the date the correction was made unless
              that other organisation does not need the corrected personal data
              for any legal or business purpose.
